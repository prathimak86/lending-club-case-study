# Problem Statement
When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:
If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company
The objective here is to find out the applicants who are more likely to be become defaulters. 
The analysis helps the lending company to find out such applications and refrain from lending loans such that they don't infer any loss.
